The aim of the project is to promote improved public health by encouraging people, with a special emphasis on young people, to express their mental well-being and seek professional assistance when needed. The project is urgent, considering that between 500 and 600 people seek help at clinics and hospitals in Iceland due to self-harm following anxiety every year. Suicide is the most common cause of death for young men in Iceland."
